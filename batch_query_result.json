      "The grace period for premium payment under the National Parivar Mediclaim Plus Policy is 15 days. During this period, coverage will not be available from the due date of instalment premium till the date of receipt of premium by the Company. If the instalment premium is not paid on due date, the Policy will get cancelled. No interest will be charged if the instalment premium is paid within the stipulated grace period. The grace period means the specified period of time immediately following the premium due date during which a payment can be made to renew or continue a Policy in force without loss of continuity benefits such as waiting periods and coverage of pre-existing diseases. Coverage is not available for the period for which no premium is received. The Insured will get the accrued continuity benefit in respect of the 'Waiting Periods', 'Specific Waiting Periods' in the event of payment of premium within the stipulated grace Period. In case of instalment premium due not received within the grace period, the Policy will get cancelled. In the event of a claim, all subsequent premium instalments shall immediately become due and payable.",
